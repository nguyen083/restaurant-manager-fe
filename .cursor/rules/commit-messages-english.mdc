# Commit Message Language Rule

## English-Only Commit Messages

All commit messages must be written in **English only**. This ensures consistency and readability for all team members.

### Guidelines:
- Use clear, concise English for commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when applicable (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- Use present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters when possible
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" not "Fixes bug")

### Examples:
✅ **Good (English):**
- `feat: add user authentication system`
- `fix: resolve login form validation issue`
- `docs: update API documentation`

❌ **Avoid (Non-English):**
- `feat: thêm hệ thống xác thực người dùng`
- `fix: sửa lỗi validation form đăng nhập`

### Note:
This rule applies to all commits regardless of the developer's native language. English ensures better collaboration and understanding across the development team.
